/**
 * BOS Phase 0 (P0) — Tenant Context.
 *
 * A `TenantContext` is the *resolved runtime identity* of a request: which
 * tenant it acts within and what the actor's role is there. This is the single
 * seam every later BOS phase reads and writes through (Organization → Business
 * → Location, Membership, Capabilities), so it is introduced now — before any
 * of those entities exist — with the future fields reserved but unpopulated.
 *
 * In P0 the context is purely *descriptive*: it does not grant or deny anything
 * (authorization still lives in requireRole / service-level ownership checks).
 * `businessId` is defined as EXACTLY today's resolved restaurant — the same
 * value `getOwnRestaurantId(userId)` returns — so it is a strict superset of
 * current behavior and never a new scoping path. See P0_EXECUTION_SPEC.md and
 * PR_P0_1_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.
 *
 * PR-P0.1 scope: this module is a pure, unit-tested building block. Nothing
 * mounts it or reads `req.tenant` yet — wiring is PR-P0.2, consumption is
 * PR-P0.3, both out of this PR's scope.
